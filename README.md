Recovering symbols for the game Syndicate Wars by Bullfrog.

# Overview

This repository contains binaries and symbols related
to Syndicate Wars.

The purpose of gathering these is to name functions and
global variables in the assemby blob within Syndicate Wars
Port.

# Content

* `bin` folder contains executable files useful for the
symbol recovery.

* `symbols` folder contains the symbols, in a format
which is not dependent on any specific RE tool.
In particular, these files can be used both with IDA Pro
and with Ghidra.

## Binaries

Several binaries from Bullfrog are included. Some
have debug symbols embedded in the EXE, some have
additional debug messages within code.

There is also a modified version of `wdump.exe` which
allows extracting debug info from binaries built with
Watcom C++ compiler.

## Symbols

Symbols are included in two formats:

* `map` format is a very simple, basic format, based
on log files generated by Microsoft compilers (though
other compilers today have an option to generate MAP
file as well). It is very easy to read and load into
any disassembler; to load it into Ida Pro, use
`ida-pro-loadmap` plugin.

* `xml` format is developed for more complex sharing
of symbols between Ida Pro and Ghidra. Use Ghidra IDAPro
Extensions to load them into any of these tools.
